                    <p class="news-excerpt">As the investigation into the collapse of a building continues following last weekâ€™s devastating earthquake in neighbouring Myanmar, four Chinese nationals have been detained in Thailand's Bangkok for attempting to steal sensitive documents from the site.

                        According to Thai news portal The Nation, the men were caught illegally entering the area of a high-rise building that collapsed during last week's powerful earthquake and removing over 30 files from there.</p>

                    <p class="news-excerpt">The number of deaths caused by a massive earthquake that hit Myanmar and Thailand rose in both countries on Sunday. In Myanmar, about 1,700 people are confirmed dead so far, about 3,400 injured and around 300 more missing, according to the ruling junta.

                        Likewise, the number of deaths in Bangkok rose to 17, according to city authorities. According to the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority, 32 people were injured and 82 still unaccounted for - most from the site of a 30-storey tower block under construction that collapsed when the 7.7 magnitude quake struck on Friday.
                        
                        The quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar, and was followed by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock minutes later. It destroyed buildings, downed bridges, and buckled roads across the country, with massive destruction seen in Mandalay, the country's second biggest city and home to more than 1.7 million people.</p>

                    <p class="news-excerpt">A 33-storey high-rise collapsed in Thailand's Bangkok after a massive 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar and tremors were felt across the South Asian region on Friday afternoon, with aftershocks striking the region multiple times.

                        The unfinished building was reduced to rubble in a few seconds, and it was a race against time to search for survivors. However, the Bangkok police told NDTV that "Most of the victims are probably dead and there's less than one per cent chance of finding any survivors."</p>
